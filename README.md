## Canteen Wars 
![alt text](https://github.com/pkupilas/Games/blob/master/_Resources/canteenwarsgif.gif?raw=true "Canteen Wars demo game")  
**Unity version:** 5.6  
**Description:** Game created in less than 2 days as a recruitment assignment. CanteenWars is a 2D Platform Game. It takes place at the school
canteen while lunch break. One brave pupil decides to stand against Evil Lunch
Lady’s dictatorship. It's Spaghetti Day, so there are limited food options in the buffet
today!  
**Design:** CanteenWars is one-button-only game. A player can use only spacebar to
control the whole game flow. The project has 4 scenes: menu, main scene of the
game, lose and win end screens. The gameplay is simple. A player can take food
from the red spot on a moving platform. After that they need to choose direction and
angle of the shot. If hit, the enemy gets damaged accordingly to the type of food. The
enemy can toss food as well.  
**Combo:** Main mechanic in this game is food combining. When a player hits noodle
with sauce, a big spaghetti bowl appears. It falls on player/enemy side, depending on
which side of the canteen they were combined.
